      "Over a 5 month time, the newest Smart-Home Technologies were obtained and installed, with most components not even available to the public in this Country yet. Custom scalloped Solid Wood Paneling, made from some very special and rare South American wood—the likes of which cannot be obtained in this country anymore. Hand-picked craftsmen, world-class millworkers, and some extremely talented artisans who installed hand-applied specialty wall finishes, all worked in perfect harmony to deliver this one-of-a-kind ocean-side, high-rise residence, on time, on budget, and with every aspect of this remodel being on point. The delivery was flawless and made-ready for a world renown Interior Designer, who had nothing but praise for the fit and finish, throughout. All of this was accomplished at the height of a tragic world events, when everywhere else, the world had come to a screeching halt. Our hand-picked, old-world style craftsman, and modern technologists seamlessly went about their work, without faltering. The rare wood was sourced from another millwork company with a tragic cancelled order during this tragic time period. Going the extra many, many miles to Source the wood material, and then stepping in to purchase the lot, allowed for many jobs to be saved. Some of the Solid wood panels were even bent, into 1/4-rounds, using old-world wood bending techniques, to form the beautiful ends of the custom built-ins, in the Living Room. The residence was transformed from all white, to warm and beautiful. On Budget, On Schedule, and Perfectly On Point, thanks to a harmonious and incredible group of hand-picked craftsmen!",
