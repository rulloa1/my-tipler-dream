    description: "Over 11 months, we reshaped a 1.2-acre mountain site in Big Sur, a project that required both heavy machinery and a delicate touch. We moved over 3,000 cubic yards of earth, constructed 320 linear feet of retaining walls, and built a 900 sq ft custom garage and workshop. Our work focused on erosion control and drainage systems, all while preserving the property's stunning ocean views and protecting the natural landscape.",
