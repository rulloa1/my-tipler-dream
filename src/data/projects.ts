This incredible scalloped paneling and built-ins with 1/4-round wood ends added a softer feel and sense of warmth. This special residence was renovated using specially sourced wood, smart home technology, and a millwork company specializing in the most prestigious hotels & resorts in the world. Oversight, management, and budgets had to be on point, as all work was performed at the beginning of 2021 during the height of the pandemic, yet suffered no delays because of world events.",
